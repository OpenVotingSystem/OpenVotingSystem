Open Voting System 

This is the official github of the Open Voting System project, a Python framework to implement cryptographically secure voting systems with a focus on homomorphic encryption. Algorithms such as Pailler Cryptosystem are used. The ultimate goal of the project is to have a comprehensive framework for web voting systems with a variety of tools and support to ensure the security and integrity of the results. 

All code that is well-written and fits in with the above vision is welcome.
